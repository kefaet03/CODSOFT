## Introduction

During my internship at CodSoft, I worked on several machine learning projects that involved real-world data analysis and model building. This repository showcases the tasks and projects I completed, demonstrating various machine learning techniques and data processing methods.

## Projects

### Task 1: Bank Customer Churn Predictor

**Description**: This project involves predicting customer churn for a banking institution. The model analyzes customer data to predict whether a customer is likely to exit the bank.

**Key Features**:
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Model training using RandomForestClassifier
- Model evaluation and prediction

**Files**:
- `BankCustomerChurnPredictor.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code and analysis.
- `model.pkl`: Serialized RandomForestClassifier model.

**Usage**:
1. Load the `model.pkl` file to make predictions.
2. Use the Jupyter notebook for detailed analysis and model training.

### Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Description**: This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using credit card data. The goal is to build a model that can identify potentially fraudulent transactions.

**Key Features**:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training using various classifiers
- Model evaluation and prediction

**Files**:
- `FraudTransactionDetector.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code and analysis.
- `model.pkl`: Serialized model for fraud detection.

**Usage**:
1. Load the `model.pkl` file to make predictions.
2. Use the Jupyter notebook for detailed analysis and model training.

### Task 3: Detecting Spam SMS

**Description**: This project involves building a model to detect spam SMS messages. The model classifies text messages as either spam or not spam based on their content.

**Key Features**:
- Text data preprocessing
- Feature extraction using techniques such as TF-IDF
- Model training using algorithms like Naive Bayes or SVM
- Model evaluation and prediction

**Files**:
- `SpamSMSDetector.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code and analysis.
- `model.pkl`: Serialized model for spam detection.

**Usage**:
1. Load the `model.pkl` file to make predictions.
2. Use the Jupyter notebook for detailed analysis and model training.

### Task 4: Predicting Movie Genre

**Description**: This project focuses on predicting the genre of movies based on their descriptions or other features. The model classifies movies into different genres using natural language processing techniques.

**Key Features**:
- Text data preprocessing and feature extraction
- Model training using classification algorithms
- Model evaluation and prediction

**Files**:
- `MovieGenrePredictor.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code and analysis.
- `model.pkl`: Serialized model for genre prediction.

**Usage**:
1. Load the `model.pkl` file to make predictions.
2. Use the Jupyter notebook for detailed analysis and model training.

## Installation
